I created a simple CRUD application with a user-friendly interface. Following the assignment's requirements, I utilized HTML and CSS for the frontend, and Python Django for the backend.


I created a web form with input fields for gender, full name, email address, mobile number, address, username, password. If the input is valitation  created a new user information save in the databasae

clear error messages to users if any input fails validation, guiding them on how to correct the errors.

new user is created through the form submission, instantiate a model object with the provided data and save it to the database using Django's


Allow users to update their respective details information except email and
username.


If you delete user accounts, you should also delete them from the database.
